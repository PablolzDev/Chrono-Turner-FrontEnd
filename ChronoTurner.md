In a world of complex productivity tools, our app stands out with its refreshing simplicity and powerful functionality.

Organise your tasks, optimise your time, and reach your goals with ease.

## Purpose
We want you to elevate your productivity. Manage your tasks with elegance and efficiency. Our minimalist application helps you focus on what truly matters, without distractions. Organise your day with clarity and style, maintaining intuitive control over your projects. Discover a new way of working, where simplicity meets efficiency.

## Target Audience
Chrono-Turner is intended for all of those who want to plan their lives in a more efficient way, so you get the most efficient way to do your tasks, for your time to yield excellent results, and to dedicate your time to cultivate yourself as a person, and/or as a professional.

## Chosen Theme
The team has found inspiration in the Harry Potter novels, especially Harry Potter and the prisoner of Azkaban, when Professor McGonagall provides Hermione with a Time-Turner, a device that can step back in time, so she "can" be in two different lessons at the same time. With that in mind, we designed Chrono-Turner, to help people to organise their tasks, according to the level of importance the user gives to each task, and the deadline, so we "magically" suggest them the order they should implement, in order to get their time as organised as possible, with maximum efficiency.
